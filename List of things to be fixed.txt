NEED TO CHANGE:
	- startChat() -> dont show your account in the list of available clients
	- individual client code -> list instead of class?? maybe
	- for UDP between clients, they need a port to use for chatting; not the port that use to connect to server
	- when new user signs up or an existing user changes password, new file is created in different directory
